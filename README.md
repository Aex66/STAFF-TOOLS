# STAFF-TOOLS
STAFF TOOLS is an addon for [MINECRAFT BEDROCK](https://www.microsoft.com/es-ec/p/minecraft-for-windows/9nblggh2jhxj?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) which has the simple utility of allowing you to control the members of your server / world / realm in a much easier way.

## HOW TO SETUP
To use **STAFF TOOLS** you simply have to add the **"Admin"** tag which will allow you to execute the command to activate **staff mode**. And this brings us to the second important thing. The command:

In order to activate staff mode you must use the command **"?staffmode"** or **"?stm"**, **"?"** is the prefix and **"staffmode"** is the command.

**_Note: When you activate the staffmode command all items in your inventory will be removed and you will get all staffmode items and staffmode benefits. When you deactivate staffmode, all lost items will be returned to you except for the items that were in the armor and off-hand slots._**
